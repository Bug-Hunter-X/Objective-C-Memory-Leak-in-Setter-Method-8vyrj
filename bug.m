In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with the `retain`/`release` cycle.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}

- (void)setString:(NSString *)newString {
    if (myString != newString) {
        [myString release];
        myString = [newString retain];
    }
}
@end
```

This code looks correct at first glance. However, if `setString:` is called multiple times without a corresponding release, the reference count of `myString` will keep increasing. When `dealloc` is eventually called, the `release` operation will not reduce it to zero, leading to a memory leak. The problem is that the condition `myString != newString` does not account for the case where `newString` is `nil`. Setting myString to nil would require explicit handling.

Another problem is that this code is not compatible with ARC (Automatic Reference Counting), and ARC is the preferred way of memory management in modern Objective-C.   Using `retain` and `release` directly is discouraged.
