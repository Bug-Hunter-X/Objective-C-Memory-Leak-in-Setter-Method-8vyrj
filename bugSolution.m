The solution involves fixing the `setString:` method to correctly handle `nil` values and using ARC best practices:

```objectivec
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass

- (void)setString:(NSString *)newString {
    if (myString != newString) {
        myString = newString; // ARC handles the retain/release automatically
    }
}

@end

//In this version we are using strong property which is handled by ARC and is a safer way. No need to manually call release or retain.
```

This corrected version leverages ARC, significantly simplifying the code and eliminating the potential for memory leaks.  The `strong` keyword ensures that the property retains the assigned string, and ARC automatically handles the release when the object is deallocated.
